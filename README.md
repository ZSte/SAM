# Inspiration
We wanted to use the internet to connect people with similar interests. We enjoy learning new languages, but it can be
really boring to teach it to yourself. Whether you have questions about grammar or if you just want to practise speaking the
new language with people that are more advaced, SAM will help you.
We wanted to connect people.
Learning languages.
Use the internet to be social.

# What it does
SAM can help you find a partner, that ideally you can learn something from and you can share your knowlege.  It makes sure, that 
your skill levels match and it shows you which partners are close to you, so it is easier to meet up and talk.
It helps find people to help you learn (programming) languages.
Helps  find the right partner
Potentially a guide how to teach language

# How we built it
Firebase
Android Studio
Java
Maps
XML
Places API

# Challenges we ran into
not too much android expierience, we had to learn new things

# Accomplishments we are proud of
//TODO

# What we learned
A lot of Android and Firebase.

# What's next for Sam
There are a lot of things that can be added to SAM. First of, public meeting points that are about in the middle of the two persons
can be suggested. 
We also thought about being able to form bigger groups, to make it even more of a social event.
The teaching doesn't have to be in person every time. Maybe we can give some guidelines on how to teach a language and can
come up with worksheets, the mentor can correct them online and give more insight on the mistakes. Maybe we can connect the app to 
social networks(e.g. facebook, Skype, WhatsApp) just to stay in contact in case of further questions, maybe even provide an own
chatroom.
